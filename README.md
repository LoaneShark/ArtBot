# ArtBot
### An bot that can read art

The ArtBot is a machine vision bot, trained on a dataset of nearly 80,000 paintings from the Kaggle 
competitions Painter By Numbers imageset. The final purpose of this bot is currently indeterminate. 

The bot uses a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) trained on the above imageset. The result will
be a bot that attempts to generate paintings, based on metadata flags (artist, style, genre, year)

The project was started in April 2018 by Bradley Beyers & Santiago Loane. It runs on Python 3.6 and
requires `numpy` and `scipy`.
